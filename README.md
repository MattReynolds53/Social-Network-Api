## Description
This application is a full functioning back-end API for a social media app. This API stores information for users, and it includes information about that user’s thoughts. Other user’s can provide reactions to those thoughts, which will be displayed in the API. You can perform all the basic GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes on this information.
